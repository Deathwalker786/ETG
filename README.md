# ELITE TECHNO GROUPS PROJECT_1
This is an Inventory Management system project that allows users to buy stuff from and keeps the record of both the current inventory and sales done

Features:
Used 5-dimensional dictionary
Products are divided in categories for easier browsing
Each product has some common attributes
Dictionary used for quantity since every size of the product has different quantity available
A proper bill is generated at the end
Loop continues until user inputs 'no' to end his shopping
The data about all the successful transaction is stored in another dictionary called history which saves this data in sales file whenever any sale is made
Program to add data to our inventory in records.json file
Used json.dumps to print dictionary vertically in proper manner

More Additions that can be made:
Wanted to add pictures but the module doesnt work due to some reasons
Better formatting
variable prices for different sizes of the product can be added 

The main file is the saud_final_project file where the information is given about which cells are to be run only once and which can be run again and again
The record.json contains the record about the current products in the inventory
The sales.json contains the record about the sales made 

NOTE: THE PRICE OF ANY PRODUCT IN THIS PROJECT DOES NOT DEPEND ON THE SIZE OF THE PRODUCT THE PRICES ARE FIXED


The add_inventory file is something that can be used to add data(new products) to the inventory which is the record.json file
